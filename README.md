# wasm3-rs

Rust wrapper for [WASM3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3).

This is currently very much work in progress.

## Building
This crate currently does not make use of the cmake project of wasm3, meaning cmake is not required to built this for the time being.
It does however require [Clang 9](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#9.0.0) to be installed.
